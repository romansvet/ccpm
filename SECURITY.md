# CCPM Security Documentation

## Overview

CCPM implements a security-hardened permission model for Claude Code integration, following the principle of least privilege to minimize security risks while maintaining full functionality.

## Security Model

### Permission-Based Access Control

CCPM uses Claude Code's permission system to restrict command execution to only necessary operations:

- **Scoped Commands**: All bash commands are explicitly scoped to specific patterns
- **No Wildcards**: Dangerous wildcard patterns like `Bash(*)` are prohibited  
- **Directory Restrictions**: File operations are limited to project-relevant directories
- **Command Validation**: All permitted commands are individually reviewed and validated

### Core Security Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only the minimum necessary permissions are granted
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Fail Secure**: Default deny approach for all operations
4. **Transparency**: All permissions are explicitly documented and auditable

## Permission Categories

### Git Operations
```json
"Bash(git status)",
"Bash(git add .)",
"Bash(git add:*)",
"Bash(git commit -m:*)",
"Bash(git push:*)",
"Bash(git checkout:*)"
```

**Security Note**: Git operations are scoped to standard repository management. No dangerous operations like `git reset --hard` or arbitrary git commands are permitted.

### GitHub CLI Operations
```json
"Bash(gh issue view:*)",
"Bash(gh issue list:*)",
"Bash(gh issue create:*)",
"Bash(gh pr view:*)",
"Bash(gh repo view:*)"
```

**Security Note**: GitHub operations are limited to read/write operations on issues and pull requests. No administrative operations are permitted.

### File Operations
```json
"Bash(mv .claude/*:*)",
"Bash(cp .claude/*:*)",
"Bash(rm .claude/*:*)",
"Bash(touch .claude/*:*)"
```

**Security Note**: File operations are scoped to project directories (`.claude/`, `ccpm/`) and cannot access arbitrary system files.

### Python Operations
```json
"Bash(python -m pytest:*)",
"Bash(python -c:*)",
"Bash(pip install ccpm)",
"Bash(pip install build)"
```

**Security Note**: Python operations are limited to testing and specific package installations. Arbitrary pip installs are not permitted.

## Security Validations

### Automated Security Checks

The following security validations are performed automatically:

1. **Permission File Syntax**: JSON syntax validation
2. **Dangerous Pattern Detection**: Scans for overly broad patterns
3. **Command Scope Validation**: Ensures all commands are properly scoped
4. **Repository Reference Validation**: Verifies correct repository references

### Manual Security Reviews

Regular security reviews should include:

1. **Permission Audit**: Review all permissions for necessity
2. **Command Pattern Analysis**: Ensure no dangerous wildcards are introduced
3. **Directory Scope Review**: Validate directory access is appropriately limited
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify functionality works with restricted permissions

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

1. **Arbitrary Command Execution**: Prevented by scoped command patterns
2. **File System Access**: Limited to project directories
3. **System Modification**: No system-level operations permitted
4. **Credential Exposure**: No operations that could expose secrets
5. **Repository Tampering**: Git operations are limited to standard workflows

### Attack Vectors Considered

1. **Command Injection**: Mitigated through scoped patterns and input validation
2. **Directory Traversal**: Prevented by explicit directory restrictions
3. **Privilege Escalation**: No operations that elevate privileges
4. **Data Exfiltration**: No operations that could access sensitive system data

## Security Configuration

### Directory Restrictions

```json
"additionalDirectories": ["/tmp/ccpm"]
```

- Access limited to project-specific temporary directory
- No access to system directories or user home directories
- Prevents unauthorized file system access

### Command Restrictions

#### Prohibited Patterns
- `Bash(*)` - Too broad, allows any command
- `Bash(rm *)` - Dangerous file deletion
- `Bash(git *)` - Unrestricted git access
- `Bash(sudo *)` - Privilege escalation
- `Bash(curl *)` - Arbitrary network access

#### Permitted Patterns
- `Bash(git status)` - Specific git command
- `Bash(git add:*)` - Scoped git operation
- `Bash(.claude/scripts/pm/*)` - Project-specific scripts

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Detection

1. **Permission Violations**: Logged and blocked automatically
2. **Unusual Activity**: Monitor for unexpected command patterns
3. **File Access Anomalies**: Watch for attempts to access restricted directories

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate**: Block suspicious operations
2. **Investigation**: Review logs for security violations
3. **Mitigation**: Update permissions if necessary
4. **Documentation**: Record incidents and lessons learned

## Compliance and Auditing

### Security Audit Checklist

- [ ] All permissions explicitly documented
- [ ] No wildcard patterns present
- [ ] Directory access appropriately scoped
- [ ] Command patterns validated
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Security documentation current

### Compliance Testing

Run the security validation suite:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_permission_compliance.py -v
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_security_validation.py -v
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Permission Reviews**: Always review permission changes
2. **Minimal Scope**: Request only necessary permissions
3. **Testing**: Validate functionality with restricted permissions
4. **Documentation**: Document security implications of changes

### For Security Reviewers

1. **Threat Analysis**: Consider potential abuse of new permissions
2. **Scope Validation**: Ensure permissions are appropriately limited
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify security controls don't break functionality
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure security implications are documented

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or to report vulnerabilities:

- Create an issue with the `security` label
- Include detailed description of potential security implications
- Provide steps to reproduce if applicable
