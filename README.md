## Transform PRDs into shipped features using spec-driven development

Transform PRDs into shipped features using GitHub Issues and parallel AI agents.

Stop losing context. Eliminate task blocking. Reduce shipped bugs.
This battle-tested system turns product requirements into production code
with full traceability at every step.

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

### 1. Install CCPM

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm.git
```

The installer automatically:

- ✅ Installs GitHub CLI if needed
- ✅ Sets up GitHub authentication
- ✅ Installs required extensions
- ✅ Configures your environment

### 2. Set Up Your Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Set up CCPM
ccpm setup .

# Initialize the PM system
ccpm init
```

### 3. Ship Your First Feature

```bash
# In Claude Code, create a comprehensive PRD
/pm:prd-new user-authentication

# Transform PRD into technical implementation plan
/pm:prd-parse user-authentication

# Break down and sync to GitHub in one command
/pm:epic-oneshot user-authentication

# Start implementing with parallel agents
/pm:issue-start 1234
```

🎉 **That's it!** You're now using spec-driven development with full GitHub integration.

## How It Works

    D --> E[Parallel Execution]
```

### The 5-Phase Discipline

1. **🧠 Brainstorm** - Think deeper than comfortable
2. **📝 Document** - Write specs that leave nothing to interpretation
3. **📐 Plan** - Architect with explicit technical decisions
4. **⚡ Execute** - Build exactly what was specified
5. **📊 Track** - Maintain transparent progress at every step

### Why GitHub Issues?

- **🤝 True Team Collaboration** - Multiple Claude instances work simultaneously
- **🔄 Seamless Human-AI Handoffs** - Progress visible to everyone
- **📈 Scalable Beyond Solo Work** - Add team members without friction
- **🎯 Single Source of Truth** - Issues are the project state

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Execution

Traditional approach: One issue = One developer = Sequential work

#### CCPM approach: One issue = Multiple parallel work streams

Example: "Implement user authentication" becomes:

- **Agent 1**: Database schema and migrations
- **Agent 2**: Service layer and business logic  
- **Agent 3**: API endpoints and middleware
- **Agent 4**: UI components and forms
- **Agent 5**: Tests and documentation

All running **simultaneously** in the same worktree.

### Context Optimization

- Main conversation stays strategic
- Each agent handles its own context in isolation
- Implementation details never pollute main thread
- Use specialized agents:
  - `file-analyzer` - Summarize logs and verbose outputs
  - `code-analyzer` - Search code and trace logic
  - `test-runner` - Execute tests with full analysis
  - `parallel-worker` - Coordinate parallel work streams

### Team Collaboration

GitHub Issues enable:

- Multiple Claude instances working simultaneously
- Real-time progress visibility for all team members
- Seamless handoffs between AI and human developers
- Integration with existing GitHub workflows

## Troubleshooting

## Key Features

### ⚡ **Parallel Execution**

Ship faster with multiple agents working simultaneously. Tasks marked
`parallel: true` enable conflict-free concurrent development.

### 🔗 **GitHub Native**

Works with tools your team already uses. Issues are the source of truth,
comments provide history, and there is no dependency on the Projects API.

### 🤖 **Agent Specialization**

Right tool for every job. Different agents for UI, API, and database work.
Each reads requirements and posts updates automatically.

### 📊 **Full Traceability**

Every decision is documented. PRD → Epic → Task → Issue → Code → Commit.
Complete audit trail from idea to production.

### 🚀 **Developer Productivity**

Focus on building, not managing. Intelligent prioritization, automatic context
loading, and incremental sync when ready.

## Proven Results

Teams using this system report:

- **89% less time** lost to context switching – you'll use `/compact` and
  `/clear` a LOT less
- **5-8 parallel tasks** vs 1 previously – editing/testing multiple files at
  the same time
- **75% reduction** in bug rates – due to the breaking down features into
  detailed tasks
- **Up to 3x faster** feature delivery – based on feature size and complexity

   > automatically backed up to `.claude.backup` and your user content will be
   > preserved during installation.

   See full/other installation options in the
   [installation guide ›](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm/tree/main/install)

2. **Initialize the PM system**:

   ```bash
   /pm:init
   ```

   This command will:
   - Install GitHub CLI (if needed)
   - Authenticate with GitHub
   - Install [gh-sub-issue extension](https://github.com/yahsan2/gh-sub-issue)
     for proper parent-child relationships
   - Create required directories
   - Update .gitignore

3. **Create `CLAUDE.md`** with your repository information

   ```bash
   /init include rules from .claude/CLAUDE.md
   ```

   > If you already have a `CLAUDE.md` file, run: `/re-init` to update it with
   > important rules from `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

4. **Prime the system**:

   ```bash
   /context:create
   ```
