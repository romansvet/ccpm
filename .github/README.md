# CCPM GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for the CCPM (Cross-Platform Command Project Manager) project.

## 🎉 **Status: Production Ready**

All workflows are **fully functional** and tested across **Ubuntu**, **macOS**, and **Windows** platforms. The cross-platform compatibility issues have been resolved and CI runs successfully on all target platforms.

## Workflows Overview

### 🔄 `ci.yml` - Cross-Platform CI ✅
**Triggers:** Pull Requests, Pushes to main, Manual dispatch
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive testing across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
- **Features:**
  - ✅ **Multi-OS testing matrix** (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
  - ✅ **Makefile-based test execution** with unified cross-platform support
  - ✅ **Install script validation** for both `.sh` and `.bat` installers
  - ✅ **Automatic PR status comments** with success/failure reporting
  - ✅ **Test log artifacts** for debugging and analysis
  - ✅ **Platform-specific optimizations** for Git Bash on Windows
  - ✅ **Portable shebang support** verification

### ⚡ `status-check.yml` - Quick Status Check ✅
**Triggers:** Pull Requests, Pushes to main
- **Purpose:** Fast validation for required status checks
- **Features:**
  - ✅ **File existence validation**
  - ✅ **Makefile syntax checking**
  - ✅ **Shell script syntax validation**
  - ✅ **Portable shebang verification**
  - ✅ **Quick system tests**

### 🚀 `release-test.yml` - Release Testing ✅
**Triggers:** Release creation, Version tags, Manual dispatch
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive testing for releases
- **Features:**
  - ✅ **Full test suite execution**
  - ✅ **Installation process validation**
  - ✅ **Release quality assurance**
  - ✅ **Multi-platform release reports**

## 🏗️ Cross-Platform Implementation

### **Unified Architecture**
The workflows now use a **unified cross-platform approach**:

- **Windows**: Uses Git Bash environment with Unix-like commands
- **macOS/Linux**: Native Unix environment
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same Makefile commands work identically across platforms

### **Key Technical Achievements**
- ✅ **Portable Shebangs**: All scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- ✅ **Unified Path Handling**: Forward slashes work on all platforms
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Makefile**: Single implementation for all OS
- ✅ **Git Bash Compatibility**: Windows CI uses Git Bash successfully
- ✅ **Shell Script Execution**: `.sh` files run on all platforms including Windows

## Setting Up Branch Protection

To enforce passing status checks before merging PRs, configure branch protection rules:

### Required Status Checks

1. **Go to Repository Settings → Branches**
2. **Add or Edit protection rule for `main`/`master`**
3. **Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"**
4. **Add these required status checks:**
   - `Quick Status Check`
   - `Test on Ubuntu Latest`  
   - `Test on macOS Latest`
   - `Test on Windows Latest`

### Recommended Branch Protection Settings

```yaml
# Example branch protection configuration
Branch: main
Settings:
  ✅ Require a pull request before merging
  ✅ Require approvals: 1
  ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  ✅ Require review from code owners (if CODEOWNERS file exists)
  ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
  ✅ Include administrators (recommended for consistency)
```

## Workflow Features

### 🎯 Manual Dispatch Options

The `ci.yml` workflow supports manual execution with options:
- **Test Suite Selection:** `all`, `test-only`, `install-only`
- **Debug Mode:** Enable detailed debugging output for troubleshooting

### 📊 Artifacts and Reporting

- **Test Logs:** Automatically uploaded for all builds (success and failure)
- **PR Comments:** Automatic status updates on pull requests with detailed results
- **Release Reports:** Detailed testing reports for releases
- **Cross-Platform Artifacts:** Separate logs for each OS for easier debugging

### 🔍 Advanced Features

- **Smart Matrix Configuration:** Optimized for parallel execution
- **Platform-Specific Steps:** Windows/Unix separation where needed
- **Graceful Error Handling:** Tests complete with warnings rather than hard failures
- **Comprehensive System Information**: Detailed OS/environment reporting

## Local Testing

Before pushing changes, test locally using the **cross-platform Makefile**:

```bash
# Run all tests (works on all platforms)
make test

# Check system requirements  
make check-system

# Show platform information
make info

# Test PM functionality
make pm-help
make pm-status
make validate

# Test cross-platform features
make pm-search QUERY="test"

# Clean up
make clean-all
```

### Platform-Specific Testing
```bash
# On Windows (Git Bash)
make test          # Uses unified approach

# On macOS/Linux
make test          # Same commands, same results

# Manual install testing
make install       # Platform-appropriate installer
```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### 🔍 Current Debugging Process

#### 1. Check Workflow Status
- ✅ Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
- ✅ All platforms should show green checkmarks
- ✅ Check individual job logs for detailed information

#### 2. Download Artifacts
- ✅ Test logs automatically saved for all runs
- ✅ Platform-specific artifacts for easier debugging
- ✅ Comprehensive logs available for 7 days

#### 3. Local Reproduction
- ✅ Use `make test` to run identical tests locally
- ✅ Use workflow dispatch with debug enabled
- ✅ All platforms use same commands for consistency


## Maintenance and Updates

### 🔄 Routine Maintenance
- **Runner Updates**: Can safely update to newer runner versions
- **Dependency Updates**: All platforms use same dependencies
- **Matrix Modifications**: Easy to add new platforms or configurations

### 🚀 Adding New Platforms
To add new platforms (e.g., `ubuntu-20.04`, `windows-2019`):
1. ✅ Add to matrix in `ci.yml`
2. ✅ No platform-specific code changes needed
3. ✅ Update required status checks in branch protection
4. ✅ Test with manual dispatch first


## Contributing

When modifying workflows:
1. ✅ **Test locally first** using `make test`
2. ✅ **Use workflow dispatch** for safe CI testing
3. ✅ **Update documentation** to reflect any changes
4. ✅ **Verify all platforms** still pass after modifications
5. ✅ **Test branch protection** rules continue working

### 🔧 Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
make test

# 2. Test specific functionality
make pm-help
make validate

# 3. Clean up before commit
make clean-all

# 4. Push and verify CI passes on all platforms
# 5. Create PR and verify status checks
```
